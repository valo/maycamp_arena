## Description

The idea of this project is to provide a grading system
for competitions in informatics ([IOI][IOI] style).
The main target group is high school students.

The system contains two main components:

* Web part
* Grader

The *web part* is a Ruby on Rails application,
contained in the app folder.

The *grader* [compiles](https://github.com/valo/maycamp_arena/blob/0923c323a6026ff9a440991141b177c6eed1c481/app/services/grade_run.rb#L43)
the source code and [runs](https://github.com/valo/maycamp_arena/blob/0923c323a6026ff9a440991141b177c6eed1c481/app/services/grade_run.rb#L66)
the binary inside multiple [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
containers and feeds each one with the given test cases.
It monitors the consumption of the system resources - time limit, memory limit, etc..

## Installation

The following steps describe how to run the project
on a local environment for **developing** purposes.
The best and fastest way to get the project up and running
is to use the already configured Vagrant virtual development
environment.

### Dependencies

#### General
* Git
* MySQL Server 5.5+ or MariaDB is preferred
* Ruby 2.1+ (the easiest way is to use RVM or rbenv)

#### Additional
(for the virtual environment)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
or other VM provider.
* [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)



### Setup

#### Web part
Download the project and initialize the virtual environment.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/valo/maycamp_arena.git
$ cd maycamp_arena
$ vagrant up
```
This last command may take a while to execute, considering
the fact that the proper virtual box binary
must be downloaded and provisioned.  

Configure the ruby version. Keep in mind that `rvm` is already installed on the virtual machine.

**NB!** vm is just a placeholder for vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty64

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
vm$ rvm install 2.1.1
vm$ rvm use 2.1.1
vm$ cd /vagrant
```

Install the MySQL server. *It is recommended to leave the root user without password (blank password), otherwise you should change the configurations*.
```bash
vm$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

Install the package dependencies and run the database migrations with:
```bash
vm$ bundle install
vm$ bundle exec rake db:create db:setup
```
After you have successfully completed the installation process
of the web application you can start the server with:
```bash
$vm /vagrant/bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0
```
and access it in your browser on `localhost:3030`.

### Grader

Getting the grader up and running is done with:

```bash
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ gem install god
vm$ docker build -t grader .
vm$ printf "vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:\n rsync: /vagrant/sets" > config/grader.yml
```

and running it with:
```bash
vm$ /home/vagrant/.rvm/bin/rvm 2.1 do bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production grader:start
```

### Running the tests

To run the tests execute:

```bash
$ bundle exec cucumber
```

### Access
After you have successfully set up the project you can log in
with the dummy admin account:
```
username: admin
password: 123123
```
